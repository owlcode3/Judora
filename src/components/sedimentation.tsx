          From the aeration chamber, the treated sewage (primary effluent) mixed with the activated sludge floc passes through a 150mm duct in the wall into the settling tank or clarifier. In the clarifier, the heavy activated sludge floc settles to the bottom, and the clear treated liquid flows over a weir into the secondary effluent-mixing tank. The settled sludge is then returned back to the aeration chamber by the air lift sludge return system to help in the decomposition of more incoming sewage. An airlift type skimmer, operated on the same principle, is installed in the settling tanks so that floating solids can be removed and discharged back into the aeration tank.
