          From the screening device where the sewage undergoes some form of pre-treatment, the sewage flows into the aeration chamber. In this unit sewage is decomposed by the action of bacteria and other micro-organisms in the presence of air (aerobic condition). In a properly operating plant, these micro-organisms will form a dark brown mass called activated sludge floc. The activated sludge floc is mixed with the incoming sewage and air is introduced along one side of the tank near the bottom of the tank through air diffusers, which causes mixing currents within the liquid mass. An adequate air supply is maintained to allow the organisms to decompose the sewage into carbon dioxide, water and ash. The air is provided by a positive displacement air blower housed in a metal structure mounted atop the skid. The air is piped through a rectangular box beam and air header pipes to the diffusers at the bottom of the aeration tank. A second blower for stand-by service is provided.        </p>
