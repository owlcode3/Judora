        Activated Sludge system is the processes that treat or remove pollutants and contaminants, such as soluble organic matter, suspended solids, pathogenic organisms, and chemical contaminants, from wastewater prior to its reuse or discharge from the facility to the environment without causing any community health hazard. These pollutants and contaminants are removed from wastewater using physical and chemical processes (such as sedimentation and chlorine disinfection) and biological processes. Biological wastewater treatment processes can produce CO2. The by-product of sewage treatment is usually a semi-solid waste or slurry, called sewage Sludge. The sludge has to undergo further treatment before being suitable for disposal or application to land.
