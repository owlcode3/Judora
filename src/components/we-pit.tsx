          The second screening operation is the action of the bar screens situated in the aeration tanks inlets. At the end of these two screening operations the sewage going into the plant for the treatment is completely free from any solid materials. Removal of large items from the influent to prevent damage to the facilityâ€™s pumps, valves and other equipment. The process of treating and reclaiming water from wastewater (any water that has been used in homes, such as flushing toilets, washing dishes, or bathing, and some water from industrial use and storm sewers) starts with the expectation that after it is treated it will be clean enough to re-enter the environment. As an example of expected standards, the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) of average wastewater effluent is 200 mg/L and the effluent after treatment is expected to be {'>'}30 mg/L. It is crucial a wastewater facility meets these expectations or risk stiff penalty.        </p>
